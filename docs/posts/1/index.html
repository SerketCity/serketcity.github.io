            <p>hi gamers this is just a temporary first post while i continue to build out the site. its gonna be fugly while i figure out what i wanna do for constructing this shit (im currently messing around with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and i like it a lot)</p>
<p>HOWEVER,</p>
<p>you can currently subscribe to my <a href="./../../feed.xml">feed</a> with your rss/atom reader of choice. my first real goal for this is to type up a reflection post on 2025. which!!!! kinda makes it obvious as to why i really wanted to get this done before the year ended. whoops!</p>
