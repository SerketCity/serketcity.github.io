title: THIS IS A TEMPORARY POST THAT I WILL DELETE FOREVER ONE DAY
---
hi gamers this is just a temporary first post while i continue to build out the site. its gonna be fugly while i figure out what i wanna do for constructing this shit (im currently messing around with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and i like it a lot)

HOWEVER,

you can currently subscribe to my [feed](./../../feed.xml) with your rss/atom reader of choice. my first real goal for this is to type up a reflection post on 2025. which!!!! kinda makes it obvious as to why i really wanted to get this done before the year ended. whoops!
